# Reinforcement Learning in OpenAI Gym 

This repository contains an implementation of **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** algorithms to train agents in **FrozenLake-v1** and **Taxi-v3** environments. The project explores value-based RL techniques, including **Q-learning** and **SARSA**, using OpenAIâ€™s **Gym**.

## Objectives
- Train an RL agent on **FrozenLake-v1** and **Taxi-v3** environments.
- Implement **Q-learning** and **SARSA** algorithms for discrete action spaces.
- Evaluate agent performance using reward accumulation and policy convergence.
